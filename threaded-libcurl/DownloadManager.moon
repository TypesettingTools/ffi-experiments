[[   ---------- Usage ----------

1. Create a DownloadManager:

	manager = DownloadManager!

	You can supply a single library search path or a table of search paths for the DownloadManager library.
	On Aegisub, this will default to the system and user DownloadManager module directories.
	Otherwise the default library search path will be used.

2. Add some downloads:

	manager\addDownload "https://a.real.website", "out3"

	If you have a SHA-1 hash to check the downloaded file against, use:
		manager\addDownload "https://a.real.website", "out2", "b52854d1f79de5ebeebf0160447a09c7a8c2cde4"

	You may want to keep the ID of your download to check its result later:
		id = manager\addDownload "https://a.real.website", "out2",

	Downloads will start immediately. Do whatever you want here while downloads happen in the background.
	The output file must contain a full path and file name. There is no working directory and automatic file naming is unsupported.

3. Wait for downloads to finish:

	Call manager\waitForFinish(cb) to loop until remaining downloads finish.
	The progress callback can call manager\cancel! or manager\clear! to interrupt and break open connections.

	The current overall progress will be passed to the provided callback as a number in range 0-100:
		manager\waitForFinish ( progress ) ->
			print tostring progress

4. Check for download errors:

	Check a specific download:
		if manager\error[id]
			error manager\error[id]

	Get a list of failed downloads:
		for id in *manager.failedDownloads
			print "Download #{id} error: #{manager.error[id]}"

5. Clear all downloads:

	manager\clear!

	Removes all downloads as well as results/error messages, so previous IDs become invalid.


Error Handling:
	Errors are handled in typical Lua fashion.
	DownloadManager will only throw an error in case the library failed to load.
	If any other error is encoutered the script will return nil along with an error message.
